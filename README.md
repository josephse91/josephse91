Hey, my name is Serge. 👋🏾

I typically work on web applications but have an open curiousity to learning more about mobile applications.

* Graduated Binghamton University in 2014🎓 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Experience with scripting languages such as MATLAB and Mathematica. 
* In September 2021, I began the [App Academy Open](https://www.appacademy.io/) Curriculum, becoming self-taught Fullstack Software Engineer. 
* I attended The [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) in the Summer of 2022, where I started developing a TV Show Review web application.

💫 React | Redux | JavaScript | Ruby | Rails | PostgreSQL | HTML | CSS | Git | Based in NY 🏢

I plan to continue working on my portfolio, harnessing my skills and staying involved within the coding community while I look to begin my career in software engineering/development.
