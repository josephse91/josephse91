👋 Hey my name is Serge. My goal is to consistently add to my portfolio and contribute to as many projects as possible.

Being self-taught, coding has allowed me to dive into my natural desire to solve problems at a high level. I’d like to think that problems are just solutions that haven’t reached the surface yet. 
I’m currently looking to contribute on projects that expand upon my skill sets and provide usefulness to the tech community. 

Skills/Interests: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, Redux, Jquery, Ruby, Rails, CSS, Sass, 

I envision coding being the focal point of my career going forward. I plan to continue working on my portfolio, harnessing my skills and staying involved within the coding community.
